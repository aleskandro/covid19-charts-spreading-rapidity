    <h1>Covid19 Simple Graphs</h1>

    <p>Available at <a href="https://covid-19-spreading.alessandrodistefano.eu">https://covid-19-spreading.alessandrodistefano.eu</a></p>

    <p>The lack of comparative and quantitative information by the news media in Italy brought 
    me to this simple project.
    It allows to draw charts about the spreading of Covid19: 
    absolute data, rapidity of spread, and acceleration.
    It can also be used to compare data between countries/state.
    These charts could absoletely lack any scientific meaning: 
    I'm not an epidemiology expert, but I would have them to compare Italy's outbreak crisis
    with other countries 
    and to have spreading velocity which is not currently announced by news media.
    Initially, I started to draw them manually through 
    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">Octave</a>.
    Based on the data-set available at
    <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">CSSEGISAndData</a>, 
    I just developed this simple front-end in a few hours with the hope it 
    can be useful for someone else during this COVID-19 outbreak, in Italy and in the world.
    However, I'm not a front-end developer and I'm sorry for some hacky 
    tricks and bugs: contributions are welcome :).</p>

    <p>The project is based on Angular 9, with Material, papaparse and canvasJs 
    and it is distributed under the terms of 
    <a href="https://github.com/aleskandro/covid19-charts-spreading-rapidity/blob/master/LICENSE">GPLv3</a> license.</p>

    <h2>Covid-19 data-set limitations</h2>

    <p>As already stated, comparing covid-19 spreading between countries could lack
    scientific meaning, especially with the current dataset.</p>

    <p>Infact, with the current outbreak dataset we have only <code>confirmed</code>,<code>recovered</code> and <code>deaths</code> cases per country/state;
    it would be better to also have the number of performed tests. </p>

    <p>Other considerations about limitations of these data can be made both from a stastical 
    and from a medical point of view.</p>

    <p>I hope reasearch will start publishing about modeling of this epidemic as soon as a possible,
    with all the tools we have today like Complex networks and so on.</p>

    <p>If you want to contribute, please feel free of starting a new issue or forking and continuing development. 
    If I will have time, I will try to improve the code and the available features.</p>

    <h2>Docker for develepment</h2>

    <p>Use the docker image if you do not want to deploy Angular and other dependencies of this project in your host.</p>

    <p><code>bash
    docker-compose up
    </code></p>

    <p>It will expose the angular development server through <code>http://localhost:4200</code>.</p>
